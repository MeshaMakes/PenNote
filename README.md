## **Installation**
###### You may have to run ```pub.get``` in ```pubspec.ymal``` if any errors occur

**Please note that this is being buildt for android first so you will need and android device to run on, and secondly in my preferred way of doing things I code all the UI elements then add the functionality afterwards so in the start nothing may work iinitially so bare with me.**


In the command terminal, run the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/MeshaMakes/PenNote.git
$ cd pennote/
$ flutter run
```

For Android

```
Ensure that you have an Android emulator connected, whether virtual or physical.
Run the following command in the ternimal.
$ flutter run

Or select your device from the drop down and run.
```

For Web

> Coming Soon
